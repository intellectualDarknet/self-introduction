Hi everyone, 
I'm Demidovich Alexey and I'm 23 years old. I was born in Belarus. Graduated from the Belarussian national technical university in 2020. My speciality was automatizaion of energetic processes.After my graduation i found a job related to my diploma. My job was to adjust,calibrate different kinds of sensors (sensors of pressure, temprerature, flow, and all the other).After i'd been working there for 9 months i was softly invited to the Belorussian army and I didnt have any choice but serve. I was distributed to the best kind of troops - glorious railway troops where I was tought a lot of things such as: how boil water from the socket using 2 wires and 2 spoons, how to sweep with a bar (special metallic tool to pull out nails).I was also taught how to move currectly in this life and how to be a real patriot and a real man.

So this is why I decided to act otherwise I starded learning english in the army.
After my salvation from this place i decided to be a programmer.
So,this is why i m here. I've been learning HTML,CSS for 6 months, JS aproximately for 4 months, and Node for the month and a half. I'm going to become a good software engineer. My plans are to create smth special, smth that matters for other people. In my nearest future I'll create smth like ratatype,smth like english cards to improve my skills in English.

 Despite the influence of the army my character remains mostly good: I like to grasp the meaning of things by myself, to try something new to some degree, I'm a calm, not conflicting person.
 About my cons: sometimes i'm silent and indifferent, I'm stubborn in some way, don't understand other people's feeling but sometimes can say better than that person what he feels.
 
Thank you for your attention i guess you got acquianted with me a bit and have a nice day.
